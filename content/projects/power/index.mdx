 The title for this woodblock is inspired by the song "Gimme Tha Power" by Molotov, a Mexican rock band. The song is an anthem against corruption in Mexico. It reminds the listener that the power of the people will always win. During a time when Republicans are revoking liberties once held by all Texans, this piece was a reminder that power is temporary.
