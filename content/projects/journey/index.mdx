The theme for this year's exhibition was Journey. I chose to interpret it as an introspective journey. The block shows a woman in a dream state traveling down a path that leads to the horizon. She must face her anger, fear, and happiness before she completes her journey. Happiness, however, is not the destination.

This print was bought by the owner of Saint Arnold Brewery and now hangs in the Investors Pub.
